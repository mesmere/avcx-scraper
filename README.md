## FAQ

**Q. Why am I only getting .puz files?**

**A.** `avcx-scraper` only downloads files in the AcrossLite format because that's all I care about. Some puzzles (e.g. the trivias) don't have .puz files, so they won't be downloaded. If you want a full backup of everything, it would be trivial to modify the code. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Seriously, it's one line.

**Q. Why are the filenames in this awful scheme that doesn't sort cleanly?**

**A.** Those are the filenames chosen by AVCX themselves via the Content-Disposition header. 

**Q. Will my account be banned for downloading like a thousand files at once?**

**A.** I don't know, maybe. `avcx-scraper` uses very reasonable timeouts and tries to look as much as possible like a normal user, but if anyone is ever looking through the logs it's pretty obvious.
