# avcx-scraper

This is a scraper which will download all [AVCX crosswords](https://avxwords.com/about-us/) from the official website.

## Prerequisites

- **You need an active subscription to AVCX.**
- You need to have `pipenv` installed. There are [installation instructions](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) but it's likely easiest to install with your system package manager (e.g. `sudo pacman -S python-pipenv` for Arch or `sudo apt-get install pipenv` for Debian).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/mesmere/avcx-scraper.git
cd avcx-scraper
```
2. Run `avcx_scraper.py` with your AVCX credentials:
```
pipenv run python3 avcx_scraper.py --email=YOUR_EMAIL --password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```
3. Wait for it to complete and then check the `out/` directory to find your files.

## FAQ

**Q. Why am I only getting .puz files?**

**A.** `avcx-scraper` only downloads files in the AcrossLite format because that's all I care about. Some puzzles (e.g. the trivias) don't have .puz files, so they won't be downloaded. If you want a full backup of everything, it would be trivial to modify the code. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Seriously, it's one line.

**Q. Why are the filenames in this awful scheme that doesn't sort cleanly?**

**A.** Those are the filenames chosen by AVCX themselves via the Content-Disposition header. 

**Q. Will my account be banned for downloading like a thousand files at once?**

**A.** I don't know, maybe. `avcx-scraper` uses very reasonable timeouts and tries to look as much as possible like a normal user, but if anyone is ever looking through the logs it's pretty obvious.
